# YM2612

Yamaha YM2612 (aka Sega 313-5089)

6-channel 4-operator FM synthesizer. Basically standalone version of YM2608/YM2610's FM block with the crappy YM2413 DAC.

Originally was made for the Sega Mega Drive, but then was used in FM Towns and Sega arcade boards (both in original and YM3438 form).
