# YM3438

Yamaha YM3438

CMOS version of the YM2612. DAC circuit is greatly improved and don't suffer from so called 'ladder' distortion.

Has compatibility issues with a few poorly programmed sound drivers (early GEMS versions, Hellfire, some japanese games(?) ). These games sometimes try to read chip status on illegal YM2612/YM3438 ports and thus read chip's internal bus noise.

* CMOS, 1-layer of metal
* N-pockets

## Integrated YM3438 core

YM3438 core was integrated in FC1004, FF1004, FJ3002 and FQ8007 chips.

Only known difference is that Yamaha made status port accessible on all addresses to workaround compatiblity issues. This workaround causes slow music in Hellfire
