# YMF276

Yamaha YMF276 (FC1008)

YM3438 die shrink with digital sound output.

Was made for Fujitsu for their FM Towns series of computers. FM Towns originally used YM2612, but quickly switched to YM3438 once it was available.



Just like standard YM3438, YMF276 has compatibility issues with a few Mega Drive games. To addition to YM3438 incompatible games, there's one game that writes trash data to YMF276's test port and causes it to misbehave.
